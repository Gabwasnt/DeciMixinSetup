If your here that means you know what you are doing,
the relauched name was my original idea lulu didnt want my help so im making what took me 1h to setup public

add a forge deobfuscated jar of decimation in `deci/` <- use BON2 to deobf forge mappings


this is a 1.7.10 mixin setup for the mod "Decimation"
Do not ask me to error or anything about anything relating decimation 1.7.10 is too ancient.
